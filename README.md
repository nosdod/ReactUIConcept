# Dashboard template

## Usage

The basis for the code here is one of the @mui examples - A dashboard
View the demo of that at https://mui.com/getting-started/templates/dashboard/.
Copy the files into your project, or one of the [example projects](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples), and import and use the `Dashboard` component.

## Demo
The 'look' of it now mimics the existing Entropy Loader - at least what I think the Entropy Loader looks like from examining the C# source code Dave gave me!
Opening and Closing the Tool Draw on the left adds 10k to the entropy size .... for demo purposes.
Critical and Warning levels are hardcoded at 5000 and 20000 bytes.
There is no serveside to this at the moment.

See https://mui.com for mmore on the variety of controls etc that are in @mui/material

Material-UI is just one of many UI libraries available.
